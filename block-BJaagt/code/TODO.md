Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // username is not defind
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // the above code will inside throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`
```

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // Reference Error username is not defined
```
